Wcofun.com Downloader

Used to download videos and series from https://www.wcofun.com/

Coded in JDK 8.

You need java 8 to run this program. https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

Download the releases here: https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/Wcofun.com_Downloader/releases/

JDK 8 is needed to compile it: https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All

I use IntelliJ as an IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ - The Community Version will work just fine.

A lot of work was put into this one!
I manually downloaded so many videos from wco that I decided to create this bad boy.

This downloader is multi-threaded, customizable, resizeable, fast and easy to use!

You just type a link to a series or an episode such as one of my favorites: https://www.wcofun.com/anime/to-love-ru
inside the textfield and hit ENTER or press Start

All past and current downloads will go inside this organized tab here:

You can interact with the downloads by using the Action menu buttons.

Every download will go inside their respective Series folder as shown in the image above.

Settings:

You can adjust your settings by going to Settings > Open Settings in the menu bar.

Enjoy and have fun!

Known Issue: This program does not support downloading 2 videos from one page.
Idk why this website has them, but it's best to ignore them for now.

I will fix the updater if i decide to update it in the future.
For now just check back every now and then!
