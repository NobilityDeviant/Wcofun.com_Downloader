Wcofun.com Downloader

Used to download videos and series from https://www.wcofun.com/

Coded in JDK 8.

You need java 8 to run this program. https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

JDK 8 is needed to compile it: https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All

I use IntelliJ as an IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ - The Community Version will work just fine.
