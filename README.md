# Wcofun.com Downloader

Used to download videos and series from https://www.wcofun.net/

Coded in JDK 8 and Kotlin.

You need java 8 to run this program. https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

You will need Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Edge, Firefox or Safari to use this program.

> This program relies heavily on Selenium. The driver for the chosen browser will automatically download.

Download the releases here: https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/Wcofun.com_Downloader/releases/

JDK 8 is needed to compile it: https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All

I use IntelliJ as an IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ - The Community Version will work just fine.

A lot of work was put into this one!
I manually downloaded so many videos from wco that I decided to create this bad boy.

This downloader is multi-threaded, customizable, resizeable, fast and easy to use!
Utilizes Kotlin's coroutines for a fast and smooth experience.

You just type a link to a series or an episode such as one of my favorites: https://www.wcofun.net/anime/to-love-ru
inside the textfield and hit ENTER or press Start

Will update screenshots on next release.

# Downloads

All past and current downloads will go inside this organized tab here:

![Alt text](images/downloads.png?raw=true "Download Tab")

You can interact with the downloads by using the Action menu buttons.

Every download will go inside their respective Series folder as shown in the image above.

# Settings

![Alt text](images/settings.png?raw=true "Settings Window")

You can adjust your settings by going to Settings > Open Settings in the menu bar.

# Series Details

With the new cache system, you don't even need to visit wco to check out a series details!

# Download Confirm

![Alt text](images/downloadconfirm.png?raw=true "Download Confirm Window")

You are now able to select all the episodes inside a series you want to download!
It feels so much better than the max episodes option.

# WCO Database

![Alt text](images/wco.png?raw=true "WCO Window")

Now as an optional download, you can view ALL the series inside wcofun all from this simple window.
It has the same categories (minus OVA because it's just in dubbed/subbed) and is so much easier to use.
You can even use the search bar to filter through a keyword, or genre.
Why doesn't wco have images next to their links? IDK but that's why I created this.

# Recent

![Alt text](images/recent.png?raw=true "Recent Window")

Now inside the wco window, you can view the latest episodes and series displayed on the wco home page.
Just as a little QoL feature.
Right click any entry to see the options.

Enjoy and have fun!

Known Issue: This program does not support downloading 2 videos from one page.
Idk why this website has them, but it's best to ignore them for now.
